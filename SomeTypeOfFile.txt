You are the sunshine of my life
That's why I'll always be around
You are the apple of my eye
Forever you'll stay in my heart 
I feel like this is the beginning

Though I've loved you for a million years
And if I thought our love was ending
I'd find myself drowning in my own tears

You are the sunshine of my life
That's why I'll always stay around
You are the apple of my eye
Forever you'll stay in my heart
